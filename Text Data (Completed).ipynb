    "\n",
    "When working with text data, we'll usually be dealing with many individual text\n",

    "reviews, documents, song lyrics, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with text data, there is some common language that we'll use.\n",

    "**Document**: One individual text file. If working with product reviews, a\n",
    "document would be one individual review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokens**: In processing the documents, we will break them into sequences of\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Tokenizing**: Something that might have come up in Exercise 1 is the issue\n",
    "  of punctuation. Do we include that in the token or just remove it? This is a\n",

    "  _tokenizing_ text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stop word removal**: You might have also considered how to deal with common\n",
    "  stop words (and, or, the, etc.). These words are very common in language and\n",
    "  usually link parts of sentences rather than conveying particular meaning or\n",
    "  information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stemming and lemmatization**: Another example is actually modifying the\n",
    "  unique words like shortening words from _working_ to _work_ to try and reduce\n",
    "  the number of columns in the matrix and encode commonality between sentences\n",
    "  like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`I am working.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`I am at work.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The above sentences have very similar meaning, but if we put them into a\n",
    "document-term matrix, the two sentences are going to look different because\n",
